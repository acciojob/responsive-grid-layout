### Acceptance Criteria

1. The grid layout is displayed with `3 columns` on `larger` viewports.
2. The grid layout rearranges dynamically into `2 columns` on `medium` viewports.
3. The grid layout rearranges dynamically into `1 column` on `smaller` viewports.
4. The cards have different heights and widths that maintain their aspect ratio as the viewport size changes.
5. The cards have a `gray` `background-color` and `rounded corners`.
6. The cards are `centered` both horizontally and vertically within the grid cells.
7. The cards have a `font-size` of `40px`.
